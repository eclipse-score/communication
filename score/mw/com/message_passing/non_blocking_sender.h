/// \brief This class provides a wrapper around any ISender implementation, which assures a non/never blocking behaviour
///        on Send() calls.
/// \attention It makes no sense to use it wrapping an ISender implementation, which already assures non-blocking!
///
/// \details Because of safety (ASIL-B) requirements, it is not acceptable, that a ASIL-B sender gets eventually
///          blocked by a ASIL-QM receiver (at least we want to prevent it, even if the ASIL-B app does its own runtime
///          supervision/watchdog mechanism).
///          The underlying OS specific implementations of ISender/IReceiver vary on their behaviour! Even if they all
///          need to be async to fulfil ISender contract, there is still a major difference between "async" and a
///          "non-blocking-guarantee"!
///          E.g. in QNX we currently use a ISender/IReceiver implementation based on QNX IPC-messaging. Since in QNX
///          (microkernel) there are no kernel buffers, which decouple ISender/IReceiver, a Send() call in our impl.
///          leads to a transition from sender proc to receiver proc, where our receiver impl. takes the message, queues
///          it in a locally managed queue for deferred processing and directly unblocks the sender again.
///          So in normal operation this is the most efficient solution in QNX and fully async by nature. But in case
///          some untrusted QM code within the receiver process compromises our reception thread (hinders its queueing/
///          quick ack to the sender), we could run into a "blocking" behaviour!
