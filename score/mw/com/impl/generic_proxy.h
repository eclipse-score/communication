/// This means that it can connect to a service providing instance (skeleton) just based on deployment information
/// specified at runtime.
///
/// It contains a map of events which can access strongly-typed events in a type-erased way i.e. by accessing a raw
/// memory buffer.
///
/// It is the generic analogue of a Proxy, which contains strongly-typed events. While the Proxy is usually generated
/// from the IDL, a GenericProxy can be manually instantiated at runtime based on deployment information.
