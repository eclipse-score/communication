/// \brief class holding application identifier to pid mappings for a concrete service instance.

///          concrete service instance. The ServiceDataControl and its ApplicationIdPidMapping member are created by the
///          provider/ skeleton instance. The ApplicationIdPidMapping is then populated (registrations done) by the
///          proxy instances, which use this service instance. So each proxy instance (contained within a proxy-process)
///          registers its application identifier (which is either an explicitly configured 'applicationID' or the
///          process's uid as a fallback) together with its current pid in this map. In the rare case, that there are
///          multiple proxy instances within the same process, which use the same service instance, it is ensured that
///          only the 1st/one of the proxies does this registration. These registrations are then later used by a proxy
///          application in a restart after crash. A proxy instance at its creation will get back its previous pid, when
///          it registers itself and has been previously registered. If the proxy instance does get back such a previous
///          pid, it notifies the provider/skeleton side, that this is an old/outdated pid, where the provider side
///          shall then clean-up/remove any (message passing) artefacts related to the old pid.

    ///            the last proxy instance related to this service-instance/ApplicationIdPidMapping has been destructed.
    ///            This is complex because the ApplicationIdPidMapping data-structure is placed in shared-memory and
    ///            access to it from various different (proxy)processes is synchronized via atomic-lock-free algo. The

    ///            accessing the same service-instance would need a much more complex sync, which we skipped for now.
    ///            The main downside is: In case a proxy process restarts normally (no crash) and then connects to the
    ///            same service instance again, which stayed active, it will during
    ///            ApplicationIdPidMapping::RegisterPid() get back its old pid again (since it was not unregistered) and
