// Unit tests for SkeletonEventBindingFactory are implemented in skeleton_service_element_binding_factory_test.cpp. We
// do this since the tests for SkeletonEventBindingFactory and SkeletonFieldBindingFactory are almost identical, so we
// create templated tests in skeleton_service_element_binding_factory_test.cpp. Any tests which are only relevant to
// SkeletonEventBindingFactory and NOT SkeletonFieldBindingFactory can be added here.
