TODOs:
- [ ] Broken Links need to be cleaned up
- [ ] AoU refers to a small selection in the design readme. But there is no content afterwards.
- [ ] How to inlude the puml Files in the markdown. Include dir problem
- [ ] Configuration: Symphony (a BMW internal tool) is mentioned
- [ ] ARXML is mentioned, will S-CORE depend on ARXML? I hope not.
- [ ] Configuration: sequence_startup_view.puml is not referred to in the README.md
