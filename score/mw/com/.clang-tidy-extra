# This configuration file contains user-defined extra checks for
# clang-tidy which are subject to get performed for all source
# files residing in this directory as well as its subdirectories.
#

# NOTE: Please *NEVER* specify a wildcard pattern for enabling checks,
#       such as `bugprone-*` or `performance-*`! Only disabling checks
#       would be acceptable, e.g. `-bugprone-*` or `-performance-*` etc.
#       Reason for such guideline is that, in case wildcards get used for
#       enabling checks, upgrading the clang-tidy binary to a newer version
#       would then implicitly enable the new checks available in the upgraded
#       clang-tidy binary. And then our (voting) CI jobs which are performing
#       the extra clang-tidy checks are highly subject to fail and code would
#       have to be made compliant again first. And that would block and also
#       prolong the version upgrade unnecessarily. Furthermore it is easier
#       to immediately spot which checks exactly will get performed in
#       case each one gets listed explicitly, as done below.
