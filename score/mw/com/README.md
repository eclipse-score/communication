# Communication Middleware (mw::com)

## Overview

Currently, there are two different components/libraries located under this git repo location:

- `LoLa`/`mw::com`: A high-level communication middleware as a partial implementation of the Adaptive AUTOSAR
  Communication Management specification. Also known as `ara::com` (as this is the related namespace in AUTOSAR).
- `Message Passing`: A low-level message-passing implementation, which is also used by `LoLa`/`mw::com`, but is
  independent and therefore can be used stand-alone.

The related directory structure actually needs some clean-up (see ticket
[Ticket-97144](broken_link_j/Ticket-97144)), as the `Message Passing` library has a clear/distinct
location under `/mw/com/message_passing`, while the `LoLa`/`mw::com` library already has its public API parts directly
under `/mw/com`, and its implementation and design folders are also located directly under `/mw/com`, which lacks a
clear separation between `LoLa`/`mw::com` and `Message Passing`.

Here only `LoLa`/`mw::com` will be described. `Message Passing` is described in its own
[README.md](message_passing/design/README.md).

## General introduction

`mw::com` and `LoLa` are **synonyms** right now. While the former just expresses the namespace (`mw::com` = middleware
communication), the latter is a hint on its technical implementation/unique selling point (`LoLa` = Low Latency).
Since `LoLa`/`mw::com` is our in-house implementation of the AUTOSAR standard, which &ndash; according to this standard
&ndash; resides under `ara::com`, the namespace similarity (`mw::com` â†” `ara::com`) is **intentional**.

Low latency in our `mw::com` implementation is realized by basing our underlying `technical binding` on zero-copy
shared-memory based communication.
The notion of a `technical binding` also comes from the `ara::com` AUTOSAR standard:
`ara::com` just defines a standardized user-level API and its behavior (which we generally follow with our
`mw::com` implementation). **How** an implementation realizes the public API within its lower layers
(`technical binding`) is completely up to it.
It is even common, that implementations of the `ara::com` standard come up with several different `technical binding`s
(e.g. one for local and one for network communication).

## Documentation for users

If you are an adaptive application developer in the IPNEXT project, and you want to use `mw::com` to do local
interprocess communication, you will find the user documentation here: LINK TODO.

## Requirements

Our single source of truth for requirements is **_Codebeamer_**.

- The SW-Component requirements for `mw::com` are located [here](broken_link_c/issue/5672603).
- The safety requirements for `mw::com` are located [here](broken_link_c/issue/5823087).
- The assumptions of use (AoU) for mw::com are located [here](broken_link_c/issue/6221478).
